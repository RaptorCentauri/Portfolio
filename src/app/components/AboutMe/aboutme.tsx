                My name is Dave Shilander, and I am a full stack web developer.
                My path here has not been a direct one, but it is a place where both my passion and determination has found a home.

                Growing up I was always  fascinated with computers and user interfaces. Without effort I would think, often without meaning, about algorithms, 
                about why certain elements were chosen over others in the design of a software, about how a problem could be solved quickly, and if solving that 
                problem quickly would translate into solving it efficiently. 
                Indeed, computer science was a hobby that has shaped most of my life in some form or another, and for a while thatâ€™s all it was, a hobby.
